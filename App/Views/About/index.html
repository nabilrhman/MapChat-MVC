        <p class="animated animated fadeInDownSubtle"><span style="font-weight: bolder">MapChat</span> is a location-based chatting application that lets you
                                                      talk to people from all around the world. MapChat focuses on real-time
                                                      interaction with people who donâ€™t know each other. A common use case of the app could be
                                                      to make new friends in your area or have a conversation with someone at the
                                                      same event as you. You can also tap into the local knowledge of someone from
                                                      somewhere else before you arrive on holiday in a foreign country perhaps. </p>

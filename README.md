# MapChat

MapChat is a location-based chatting application that lets you talk to people from all around the world. MapChat focuses on real-time interaction with people who donâ€™t know each other. Using MapChat, you can make new friends in your area or have a conversation with someone at the same event as you. You can also tap into the local knowledge of someone from somewhere else before you arrive on holiday in a foreign country perhaps.

The project is fully open-sourced. Visit https://github.com/nabilrhman/MapChat-MVC
